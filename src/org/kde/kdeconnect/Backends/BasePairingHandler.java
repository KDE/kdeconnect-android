/**
 * This class separates the pairing interface for each type of link.
 * Since different links can pair via different methods, like for LanLink certificate and public key should be shared,
 * for Bluetooth link they should be paired via bluetooth etc.
 * Each "Device" instance maintains a hash map for these pairing handlers so that there can be single pairing handler per
 * per link type per device.
 * Pairing handler keeps information about device, latest link, and pair status of the link
 * During first pairing process, the pairing process is nearly same as old process.
 * After that if any one of the link is paired, then we can say that device is paired, so new link will pair automatically
