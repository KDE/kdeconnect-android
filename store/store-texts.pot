"*NOTE for Ubuntu users: The Ubuntu folks are not updating their repos as fast as this app gets updated. Some features will not work if the KDE Connect version in you desktop doesn't match the one in your phone. To make sure you always have the latest version on your desktop, use this PPA  repository:  https://code.launchpad.net/~vikoadi/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/ \n"
